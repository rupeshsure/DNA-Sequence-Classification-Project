# Abstract
Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid (DNA) is a unique
macromolecule of all living species. It passes on the hereditary
data of life. Artificial Intelligence can be used to classify the DNA
class based on the sequence, as it can reduce the time taken and
can enhance the information managing limits compared to a
manual technique that is followed for ages. The main objective of
this project is to develop a machine learning model that can
improve the classification of DNA sequences.
